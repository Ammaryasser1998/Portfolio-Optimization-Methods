# Portfolio Optimization Methods
A project demonstrating the use of Monte Carlo simulations and optimization methods to maximize the Sharpe Ratio and minimize volatility in stock portfolios.

## Project Overview
This repository contains a project focused on optimizing a stock portfolio using Monte Carlo simulations. The goal is to maximize the **Sharpe Ratio** and minimize **volatility** through optimization techniques from the `SciPy` library. This project is applied to a selection of Saudi stocks, using **historical stock price data** obtained via `yfinance`.
