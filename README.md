# Portfolio Optimization Using Monte Carlo Simulation

This project demonstrates portfolio optimization using Monte Carlo simulations and optimization methods from SciPy. It aims to maximize the Sharpe ratio and minimize portfolio volatility using historical stock data from the Saudi index.

## Key Features
- Monte Carlo simulations for portfolio risk and return analysis.
- Optimization of the portfolio to maximize the Sharpe ratio and minimize volatility.
- Visualizations of portfolio performance.
